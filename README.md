## Model Files:

### MacBook Pro

This design is for MacBook Pro (tested on 16" M1 MacBook Pro) but should fit any display that is ~5mm deep.

* [Shapr3D (original model)](Models/MacBook%20Pro%20Coherence%20Camera%20Mount.shapr)

* [USDZ (for AR viewing)](Models/MacBook%20Pro%20Coherence%20Camera%20Mount.usdz)

### iMac Pro

This design is contoured to fit well on the back of an iMac Pro. It may work with other iMacs but is unlikely to work on the new Apple Silicon iMaps (perhaps the MacBook design one will work?)
